    -> app
        âœ” stick to mvc model
        âœ” vue router 
        âœ” switch between pages? (maybe need express?)

    -> homepage 
        o list of unasigned/stored, fridge, expired
    
    -> store list 
        o added stuff from used up & expired

    -> single item 
        o build express routing for :id
        o build UI
        o add new - can choose 
        o edit - show category, check used or trash (removes from list)

    -> Every page reloaded by express with Vue router... How to make it work as single page app
